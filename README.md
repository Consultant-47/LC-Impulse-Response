# LC-Impulse-Response
A LC Circuit was set up at WEL Lab on a breadboard.  
An impulse was generated by the AFG by reducing the duty cycle.  
This impulse was passed through the LC Circuit and the impulse response was measured on the DSO.  
The obtained response is in agreement with the theoretical expectation.

PS: This experiment was done as a challenge problem of EE229 taken by Prof. Vikram Gadre as a part of Group 2.
